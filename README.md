# AfricaBurn

## Intro
 For Africa Burn 2018 my camp decided to gift a sauna to the community. This guide explains how to make a 3-5m tall LED thermostat as seen on the picture below. The number of leds lighted and their individual color depends on the sauna temperature. The warmer it gets, the more leds and the redder color. At the picture the temperature range is 0-80deg where the current temperature is around 60.
